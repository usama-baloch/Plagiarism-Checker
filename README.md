# Plagiarism-Checker


There are three files name file1, file2 and file3. my approach was to identify the percentage of plague in file1 with file2 and file1 with file3 using some logic written in assembly language.

If you want to check your work with your friend and colleague then you can put your work in file1 and your friends in file2, this logic will show you the percentage of plague within beautiful CL.
